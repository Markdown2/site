Any media may be used like this

	{media}(m1)
	[m1]: img::http://mycss.com/logo.png::img-rounded::left

##### Picture

Although there is already syntax to insert picture, we really think that this should be more flexible.

	{media}(img::http://mycss.com/logo.png::img-rounded::left)

Will produce

{% highlight html %}
<img src="http://mycss.com/logo.png" align="left" class="img-rounded">
{% endhighlight %}

##### Video

This one of the most desired feature to insert video into your documents.

	{media}(youtube::ww8kIy9BtsU::420)

Will produce

{% highlight html %}
<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ww8kIy9BtsU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
{% endhighlight %}

Available sizes are `420`, `480`, `640` and `960`. Size parameter is optional and by default it is `680`.

##### Github Gists

[GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) can allow you to insert syntax highlighted code examples. You can do it in typography now too. But if you use gists, code sample will be automatically updated in the article when you or someone updated it in gist. This is very handy to have always latest actual code example without worry to update your article.

	{media}(gist::vdemedes/5220932::gistfile1.js)


will result in

{% highlight html %}
<script src="https://gist.github.com/vdemedes/5220932.js?file=gistfile1.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}

File parameter is optional and can be used only in Gists with few files and if you want to show only one of those.
