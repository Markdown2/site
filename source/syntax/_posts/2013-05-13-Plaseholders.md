Placeholders are invisible marks that add additional fictionality.

Thinking on variants. I want placeholder that even which out parsing is invisible in HTML.

- `<!--  md-readmore -->` - place to separate file into 2 parts if one part have to be show in the list. This is useful for engines that use markdown to generate blogs or static sites.

- `<!--  md-toc -->` - Will generate table of content in the place where placeholder is placed. It will use H1-H3 to create structure and name #anchors.
