Markdown2 syntax built upon [markdown 1.0.1 syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) originally by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/ ). This section does not describe Markdown 1 syntax but all that syntax works in Markdown 2.

Please use `.md2` extensions to save your Markdown 2 files. We ail recommend this extension to markdown parsers or editors developers.

### Markdown 2 target

1. We did not want to create HTML programming language. The readability of the text document is still highest priority. Our plan is to create syntax that is highly readable in `.md2` as plain text documents.
2. We want to keep Markdown markup intuitively understood like `!!!` for lead text and `--Something--`  for small or `++Something++` for big text.
