# Welcome to Markdown 2 Documentation

Thanks to [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) for Markdown! This is really great idea and concept.

But it is really getting outdated. That is proved by so many Markdown extensions like [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/) developed last years.

The aim of this project is to create public, open source Markdown specification.

# Concepts

1. Markdown 2 is backward compatible syntax built upon [markdown 1.0.1 syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

2. We recommend to use `.md2` file extension for Markdown 2 files. This will help for parser to know if current text contain M2 syntax.

3. Syntax do not have to be like another markup language. It should continue to be as readable as text as possible without reader distraction.

# Contribution

The whole idea of this project is to listen to other people what they need and make it available on all parsers.
