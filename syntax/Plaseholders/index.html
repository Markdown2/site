<p>Placeholders are invisible marks that add additional fictionality.</p>

<p>Thinking on variants. I want placeholder that even which out parsing is invisible in HTML.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>&lt;!--  md-readmore --&gt;</code> - place to separate file into 2 parts if one part have to be show in the list. This is useful for engines that use markdown to generate blogs or static sites.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><code>&lt;!--  md-toc --&gt;</code> - Will generate table of content in the place where placeholder is placed. It will use H1-H3 to create structure and name #anchors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
