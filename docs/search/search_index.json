The end HTML markup have not to be exact as in an example. For instance if you use markdown for Jekyll or MkDocs or other MD based static site generators, and you generate single page document for later processing it into PDF, you might collect notations from all documents and create one single page with all notation as bibliography. Or you might want to add notations for every page separately. Markdown 1 2 3 4 This is example [: 1 ], for notations [: 2 ].

With proper formating it may be very useful for PC related tutorials. Or comments on superuser.com or other stackoverflow.com like websites. Square brackets are used already in many places. Even in notations. The rules to convert square brackets to kbd are: It will convert any single character in square brackets. It will convert any string in square brackets from list bellow. [Ctrl] [Alt] [Shift] [Command] [Windows] [Tab] [Backspace] [Insert] [Delete] [Enter] [F(1-16)] [Ctrl *] [Alt *] [Shift *] [Command *] [Windows *] Where * is an any single symbol.
